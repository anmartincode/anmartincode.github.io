# Software Design & Engineering Narrative
## Animal Shelter Management System

### What is the artifact and when was it created?

The Animal Shelter Management System is a comprehensive MongoDB-based CRUD application designed to manage animal records for an animal shelter. Originally created during my CS-340 (Client/Server Development) course in 2023, this project demonstrates advanced software engineering principles and database management techniques.

The system provides a robust interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting animal records with comprehensive data validation, error handling, and logging capabilities. It was designed to handle real-world scenarios where data integrity and system reliability are critical.
